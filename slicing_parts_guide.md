# Slicing guide

People online recommend using the [Orca](https://orca-slicer.com) slicer for obtaining printable gcode. 

It works best with the default E3V3 settings. These may be configured manually, or (I think) you can chose the correct printer from the wizard in the slicer app. The settings are also in `orca_presets_that_work_ok`, if you want to import them.
